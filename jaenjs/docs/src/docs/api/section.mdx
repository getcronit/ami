description: Define section and connect it to Jaen
---

Sections are used to group and organize content. A section can be placed in a page or a section,
through the use of the `Field.Section` field.
The context of a section is independent of the context of the page it is placed in, so field names can be
reused across pages and sections.

See the [Section Field](/api/field#section) field for more information on how to use sections.

```tsx
import { connectSection } from '@jaenjs/jaen';

const CardSection = connectSection(() => (
  <div class="card">
    <img src="img_avatar.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%">
    <div class="container">
      <h4><b>John Doe</b></h4>
      <p>Architect & Engineer</p>
    </div>
  </div>
), {
  displayName: 'Card',
  id: 'CardSection',
});
```
