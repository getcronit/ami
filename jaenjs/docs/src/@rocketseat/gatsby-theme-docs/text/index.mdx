# Introduction

A CMS **should not** be the defining feature of a webapp. Neither should E-Commerce or anything other than your code. \
ERP integration **should not** force developers to cut corners.

- Jaen **does not** interfere with **your** user experience.
- Jean **does not** challenge **your** application design.
- Jaen gives the power back to **you**.

One thing and one thing only with clean and well documented interfaces.
Customizable, extensible and open-source.
